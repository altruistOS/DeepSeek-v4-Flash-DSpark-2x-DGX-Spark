"""CPU regressions for the bench-baseline patch-state counters.

The CHECKS block in both bench-baseline scripts counted patch markers with

    c=$(grep -c 'pattern' 'file' 2>/dev/null || echo 0)

On GNU grep, `grep -c` with zero matches prints "0" AND exits 1, so the
`|| echo 0` appended a second 0: c="0\\n0". The later `echo $c1 $c2 $c3 $c4`
word-split into up to 8 fields and the `cut -d' ' -fN` reporting read shifted
values (a real #49486 hit could be reported as 0 while #50312 showed #49486's
count). The counters now use `|| true` plus a `${c:-0}` default, which is
exactly one token in all three cases (match / no match / missing file).

These tests extract the shipped CHECKS payload from both scripts and run it
against a fake vLLM tree, asserting the emitted counters stay 1:1 with the
labelled positions.
